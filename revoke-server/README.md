This is a sample revoke server built on PHP/MySQL.

You can modify these files to match your needs, or use it as inspiration for
your own system. I won't blame you. I recommend a HTTPS connection, so you
know you're really connecting to *your* server.

I would be happy if you show me your solutions!

If you use these files, I recommend using a NGINX server with HHVM in the
background and a "Let's Encrypt" certificate.
